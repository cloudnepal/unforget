# Easy Text Formatting with Markdown

---

The main differences with the [Github flavored markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) are:
- If the first line of a note is followed by a blank line, it is a H1 header.
- Anything after the first horizontal rule `---` in a note will be hidden and replaced with a "show more" button that will expand the note.

~~~
# H1 header
## H2 header
### H3 header
#### H4 header
##### H5 header
###### H6 header

*This is italic.*.

**This is bold.**.

***This is bold and italic.***

~~This is strikethrough~~


- This is a bullet point
- Another bullet point
  - Inner bullet point
- [ ] This is a checkbox
  And more text related to the checkbox.

1. This is an ordered list item
2. And another one
